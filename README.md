# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

Refactor an Excel Workbook using VBA to expand stocks

## Results

### This is an analytical report using Excel from stock market dataset.

This report is from a period of 2017 and 2018.
The results from 2017 return analysis were a good year.
	- Only 1 of the 12 perform badly with a -7.2%
	- All others are in the green
The results from 2018 return analysis were not as good compared to 2017
	- Only 2 from the 12 performed good.
	- The other 10 were in the red
### Added a script to expand the search
	- Results from 2017 using the script to only include the 12 stock tickers was a little faster compared to looking for all tickers.

## Summary
### Advantage of refactoring code
	- There isn't much creativity since the format is already created.
	- The result is there, so there is not a lot of guessing if the information is correct when there is something to compare to
### Disadvantage of refactoring code
	- Changing the names of the values can be hard to keep up. I have more bugs on name changes. If I could keep the same, it would be a little easier to keep track.
	- Must make sure there are lined up properly and not rearrange the order of the script. Once again, I had a lot of bugs to sort out trying to make sure it was running properly
